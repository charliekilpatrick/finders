<H2> Instrument Setup (Preferred)</H2>

Generally, to avoid losing time, we should use a setup similar to the main program, as long as it covers a pretty large range of optical wavelengths.  This pretty much restricts us to the 400l/mm grating or perhaps the 600l/mm grating.  Otherwise, the following is a good setup for overing the wavelength range 3600A-7500A and keeps the annoying scattered light feature to a relatively innocuous part of the spectrum (~ 3600A):

<pre>
---------------------------------------------
Instrument:         Goodman HTS
Camera:             Blue Camera
Grating:            400 ("SYZY_400")
Filters:            None
CCD ROI Mode:       Spectroscopic, binned 2x2
CCD Readout:        200kHz ATTN 2
Mask:               1-arcsec slit
