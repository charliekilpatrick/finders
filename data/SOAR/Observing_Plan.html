<H3>A Preferred Setup for 2019A Runs</H3>

This is a preferred setup, but, if the main program is using a roughly similar setup (particularly, using the 400 or 600l/mm grating with either the Blue or the Red Camera), it saves a lot of time just to use the main program's setup and calibrations (focus, dome flats, biases, comparison arcs, and even Hamuy tertiary standard stars).

<pre>
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Camera:        Blue Camera
  
  CCD ROI Mode:  Spectroscopic, 2x2
                 (Binning 1x1 instead of 2x2 is another possibility)
  
  CCD Read:      200kHz ATTN 2

  Mask:          1.0-arcsec slit 

  Grating:       400lines/mm ("SYZY_400")

  Set Mode:      400_WD (400lines/mm, set for c. 3500A-7500A, and scattered light feature moved to c. 3600A)
                 (400_M1 is another possible preferred Set Mode)

<H3> Instrumental Calibration Check List </H3>

<i>These are usually done in the afternoon for the main program.  If we are using the same configuration as the night's main program, there is no need to repeat them.</i>

<OL>

<LI> Check central wavelength of setup by taking a test image of a Comparison Lamp

<LI> Do Focus Sequence
     <UL>
       <LI> This will often be done by the SOAR instrument scientist or another SOAR staff member at about 4PM La Serena time each afternoon.  
       <LI> If doing it yourself, basically follow the instructions on slides 64-74 of the 2017 Goodman Spectrograph Step-by-Step User's Guide 
	 (<A HREF=http://www.ctio.noao.edu/soar/sites/default/files/GOODMAN/Goodman_Tutorial_2017.pdf>web version</A>)
         <A HREF=./Goodman_Tutorial_2017.pdf>local version</A>).
	 <UL>
	   <LI> Note that the Step-by-Step User's Guide shows the case of taking a focus for the 600l/mm grating.  The process is the same for the 400l/mm grating.
	   <LI> Note that there is now a "Focus" tab in the Image Acquisition Control part of the Goodman GUI.  This automates the process of varying the camera focus and taking the focus sequence.
	   <LI> Note that the Step-by-Step User's Guide suggests a focus step size of 300 (see Slide 70 of the Step-by-Step Guide); we recommend using a step size of 100.
	 </UL>
     </UL>

<LI> After the focus sequence, adjust the Goodman configuration (slit size, CCD ROI mode, etc.) to the values you want for your targets (e.g., as in "A Preferred Setup for 2019A Runs" above).
	<UL>
	  <LI> To ensure grating is well settled, switch between your chosen set mode (e.g., "400_WD" mode), a default mode, and "grating out" a couple times (watch spectrograph image to check whether camera moves).

	  <LI> To ensure slitmask is well settled, withdraw and engage 1.0-arcsec slitmask a couple times, as well. 

	</UL>

<LI> Do WaveCal
     <UL>
     <LI> Lamps:  HgAr + Ne
     <LI> Exp time: 0.5sec
     <LI> Number:  5 in the afternoon (and 5 after every target throughout the night)
       <UL>
	 <LI> It takes about a minute for the lamps to warm up sufficiently; so might as well do a sequence of 5 and choose the 5th of each sequence for use in wavelength calibration.
       </UL>
     <LI> Be sure to ask telescope operator if lamp is on before proceeding with the exposure.
     </UL>

<LI> Do Dome Flats (replaces doing internal quartz lamp flats)

     <LI> Intensity:  100 percent

<b><i><u>Science Targets</u></i></b>

<P>

For targets brighter than i=19 or so, Steps 1-3 below should be replaced by using the GACAM to acquire the target.  Here is the info for using the GACAM:

<LI> Goodman Acquistion Camera (GACAM) Users's Manual

<P>
  Here is a check list, in PDF format, for the actions described below:  <A HREF=./OldSchoolTargetAcqForm.pdf>OldSchoolTargetAcqForm.pdf</A>.
  It is helpful to print out a copy for each target fainter than i=19 or so.  
<P>
  The following steps are also described in detail on slides 30-43 of the 2017 Goodman Spectrograph Step-by-Step User's Guide

  <A HREF=./Goodman_Tutorial_2017.pdf>local version</A>).
<P>
  (Note:  the following steps <i>are</i> kind of painful and time-consuming; so, if want,
  you can try to push the GACAM method described above to fainter magnitudes by increasing
  the GACAM's exposure time (up to 40 sec = 40,000 milli-sec is do-able.))
